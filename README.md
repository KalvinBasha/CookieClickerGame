I am fairly certain that I have met all the goals that will achieve me 3 marks, however I did do some extra animation on my button, and some personalisation on the webpage using CSS which I'm hoping will push me to that 4 mark but I am unsure if it will be enough. I am happy either way and I am confident in the 3 marks.
I don't know if there was anything I couldn't achieve if I didn't try to, but I definitely struggled with some of the local storage and setInterval parts, I looked at Tim's Demo and various websites for help often on those parts.
